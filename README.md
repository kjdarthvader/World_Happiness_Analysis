# World_Happiness_Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis of the World Happiness Reports from 2015 to 2019, aiming to understand the factors contributing to the happiness of citizens across different countries. The World Happiness Report, often subject to debate regarding its metrics, attempts to quantify global perceptions of happiness and identify key contributors to individual and societal well-being. This analysis scrutinizes these metrics to assess their validity and impact on overall happiness scores.

## Objectives
- To explore what makes citizens content with their country and identify major contributors to happiness.
- To examine the metrics of the World Happiness Reports critically and evaluate if criticisms of these measurements are valid.
- To use geographic mapping for a holistic view of global happiness trends and identify patterns between countries.

## Dataset

Each year's report comprises various metrics, such as GDP per capita, family support, life expectancy, freedom, trust in government, and generosity, contributing to a country's overall happiness score.
